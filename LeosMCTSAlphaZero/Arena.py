        coordinate system from specification) and printable objects (e.g.
        strings, numbers) as values.

    message -- A printable object (e.g. string, number) that will be placed
        above the board in the visualisation. Default is "" (no message).
    ansi -- True if you want to use ANSI control codes to enrich the output.
        Compatible with terminals supporting ANSI control codes. Default
        False.
